# 2D quantum simulation in electromagnetic potential

A particle in a 2D box in the presence of electromagnetic fields (fields not implemented yet haha).

Found an interesting algorithm based on analytic calculation of of the time evolution operator (with an approximate hamiltonian) [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.168483).
